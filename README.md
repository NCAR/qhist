# qhist

## Details
The PBS Professional scheduler includes the `qstat` command for querying active
and (optionally) recently completed jobs. Users *may* be given access to the
`tracejob` command as well, which can interrogate the historical records of a
specified job. However, it does not come with a tool to query all historical job
records.

This package aims to provide such a tool in the form of `qhist`. Modeled after
the `sacct` command in the Slurm scheduler, `qhist` allows the user to display
PBS accounting records in tabular, csv, json, and long forms.

## Installation

There are two ways to install `qhist`, with `pip` or using the included `Makefile`.

### Installing with `pip`

`qhist` is provided in package form as `pbs-qhist` via PyPI. To install `qhist`
this way, simply run the following:

```shell
python3 -m pip install pbs-qhist
```

### Installing with `make`

You may wish to provide qhist as a standalone application with its own `bin` and
`man` directories. This can be done with the provided Makefile.

```shell
make install [PREFIX=/home/$USER/qhist]
```

### Configuration

`qhist` will attempt to search for PBS accounting records at the default path:

```
$PBS_HOME/server_priv/accounting
```

However, this path is only written to on the server and thus has limited
utility. Typically, site administrators will want to mount/rsync/etc these files
to a path on hosts accessible to users (e.g., front-end nodes). In this
scenario, `qhist` will need some help in determining where to find the logs.

Additional configuration can be specified in three ways, ordered in descending
precedence:

1. Set the environment variable `QHIST_SERVER_CONFIG` to the path of your
   configuration file.
2. Put your configuration into `server.json` within the `cfg` subdirectory of
   your `qhist` installation.
3. Create a configuration file at `/etc/qhist/server.json`.

All configuration in `default.json` can be overridden in your server
configuration file as well.

## Usage

If run with no options, `qhist` will display the "end" record data for all jobs
that have finished on the current calendar day.
